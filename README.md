# seed-javascript-gui-no-framework

A seed for JavaScript user interface (user interaction) without using packages,
just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The goal of this seed project is to create the basic structure of a web client
application that interacts with the user (request and show data), without making
use of libraries or frameworks, and use it as starting point for more sophisticated
applications.

Covers:

- Get user input
- DOM manipulation to show information to the user
